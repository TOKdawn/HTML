            <p class="cdio-text">
                Back to 2001, Dalian Neusoft University of Information (DNUI) formulated and implemented an engineering education reform named ‘Five-Dimensions Knowledge Framework’ that divided learning outcomes into five high-level categories. The underlying aims of
                this framework are in line with CDIO. That is to identify the knowledge, skills, and attitudes that engineering students should possess as they leave the university, and how proficient they should be. Thus it had paved the way for DNUI’s
                application of CDIO approach to its education reform in 2008.

            <p class="cdio-text">
                With CDIO knowledge framework and further research into the industry, companies and stakeholders, DNUI issued TOPCARES-CDIO competence goals system in 2008, which inherited and innovated the CDIO framework, and then constructed its own competence goals
                system. TOPCARES-CDIO is a comprehensive and systematic reform directed by CDIO philosophy in teaching and learning. It was first implemented to engineering programs and then to all DNUI’s undergraduate programs including business, language
                and art programs.

            <p class="cdio-text">
                The TOPCARES-CDIO competence goals system is composed of 8 first-level goals, 34 second-level goals and 126 third-level goals. ‘TOPCARES’ is the acronym of the eight first-level competence goals. It also stands for the supreme affection and responsibility
                education bears to students: by promoting students’ comprehensive development in knowledge, skills and attitudes synergistically, TOPCARES-CDIO system enables universities to help students creating their own values, so they can further
                create social values with application practices. The system, as shown in Figure 4, combined with international accreditation agreements’ requirements (Washington Accords, Sydney Accords, and Dublin Accords), and industry expectation for
                talents, are then reflected in the learning objectives of different programs. Hence the graduate attributes and related competence goals of different programs can be listed explicitly.

                TOPCARES-CDIO integrates professional education, all-around development education, and innovative and entrepreneurial education into talent nurturing plans. Its integrated curriculum is outcome-based, pulled by a five-level projects system, and dynamically
                updated with industry progress. DNUI set up Student Office and Venture Office (SOVO) in 2002, a department offering entrepreneurial training, service, capital, network and culture, to improve its graduates’ innovative and entrepreneurial
                attributes as well as its ability to incubate start-ups.
